## About

Welcome to Stellar Highway... the open source repository!

Stellar Highway is a 2D endless runner developed by me (Safwan Murad) and released on the Google Play Store.

Stellar Highway is a passion project that wasn't built to make money, so as a big fan of open source and as a believer in the GPL license, it was only right to release the game open source.

This is the first videogame I created (and the first project I decided to open source) so the codes may not be the cleanest.

## Technical Requirements

You only need to install **Godot 4.5.1** and you are set.


## The Message

The game's code is under the GPL license, so you are free to do whatever you want with it, but as the game's developer I just want to say:

- If you wanna use my game as a template for your project, **please don't create gambling systems or lootboxes** in your project as microtransactions (I can't stop you if you do it, but please don't).
- If the game's code or assets helped you with your project, a **mention of me or a link to this repository** would be sincerely appreciated.
- Please don't re-release the game without changing anything.
- If you wanna support me, just **download the game from the Google Play Store** lmao.
